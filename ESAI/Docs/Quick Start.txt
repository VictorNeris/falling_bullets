                                       ESAI v4.2 Quick start

First, copy the ESAI folder to '[BF2 Install Directory]\mods\bf2\'. You may now use ESAI with any BF2 mod.

Second, you must enable ESAI inside your maps. This is done map by map, on a per game mode basis.

1. Open a level's `server.zip`, and navigate to the '\gamemode\numberOfPlayers\AI' directory.

2. Pick an ESAI map file ("Strategies.ai") that corresponds to the strategy set you want to use.
   These files are located in the folder \ESAI\MapFiles

3. Add the map file to the server zip in the directory indicated in 1.

4. Close `server.zip` and play.
