                        ESAI v 4.2 - Credits and Thanks

First off, a huge thanks goes out to the BFSP community for all the support and feedback on this project as well as for providing the documentation and resources I used to aquire my knowledge.

Also, this release would not have happened without my beta testers, to whom I am very greatful for the time and effort expended at my request.
